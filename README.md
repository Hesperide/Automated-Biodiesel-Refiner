# Biodiesel

Team: Ralph, Alex

Machine allowing for automatic transformation of used vegetable oils and methanol into refined biodiesel.  Three reservoirs allow for chemical reaction and storage of water and methanol.  All components are automatically added in proper quantities and mixed together by a custom stainless steel rotor.  Soap by-product is washed out of mix while refining brute biodiesel.  Entirely made of plumbing materials and a reused wheelchair as a frame.
